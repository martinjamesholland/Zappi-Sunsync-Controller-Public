## üöÄ Production Optimization & Maintenance

### Enable HTTPS/SSL (Highly Recommended)

For secure API communications:

1. In cPanel, go to **SSL/TLS Status** or **Let's Encrypt SSL**
2. Install a free SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
3. Your application will automatically use HTTPS

**Benefits:**
- Secure API communications with SunSync and Zappi
- Browser trust and security warnings eliminated
- Better SEO rankings

### Performance Optimization

**Enable OPcache (if not already enabled):**
1. In cPanel ‚Üí **Select PHP Version** or **PHP Extensions**
2. Enable **opcache** extension
3. This dramatically improves PHP performance

**Optimize Laravel Cache:**

If you have SSH/Terminal access, run:
```bash
cd public_html
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

**To clear caches (after updates):**
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Set Up Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)

For automated data collection and maintenance, set up a cron job in cPanel:

1. In cPanel, go to **Cron Jobs**
2. Add a new cron job:
   - **Minute:** `*` (every minute)
   - **Hour:** `*`
   - **Day:** `*`
   - **Month:** `*`
   - **Weekday:** `*`
   - **Command:** `cd /home/yourusername/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

Replace `/home/yourusername/public_html` with your actual path.

**What this does:**
- **Refreshes data mart every 15 minutes** - Updates aggregate tables for fast reporting
- Collects energy data at scheduled intervals
- Performs cleanup tasks
- Refreshes API tokens automatically

**Alternative:** If you prefer to call the ETL directly without the scheduler:
- **Minute:** `*/15` (every 15 minutes)
- **Command:** `cd /home/yourusername/public_html && php artisan app:refresh-energy-data-mart >> /dev/null 2>&1`

### Automated EV Charging Control

For automated EV charging and inverter control, you can set up an additional cron job to check EV status and adjust inverter settings:

**Recommended:** Check every 5 minutes
- **Minute:** `*/5`
- **Command:** 
```bash
curl -s "https://yourdomain.com/ev-charging/status?cron_mode=1&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Replace:
- `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain
- `YOUR_API_KEY` with your `API_KEY` from the `.env` file

**What it does:**
- Monitors Zappi EV charging status
- Automatically adjusts SunSync inverter settings when EV is charging
- Manages battery discharge to grid based on schedule
- Optimizes energy usage in real-time

**Security:** The `cron_mode=1` parameter tells the system to use API key authentication instead of session-based auth, making it safe for automated calls.

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

**Weekly:**
- Check error logs in cPanel ‚Üí **Error Log**
- Verify API connections are working
- Review disk space usage

**Monthly:**
- Update application if new version available
- Check database size and performance
- Review energy data accuracy

**After Updates:**
Always clear Laravel caches:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Backup Strategy

**Important files to backup regularly:**
- `.env` file (contains all your configuration)
- `database/database.sqlite` (if using SQLite)
- MySQL database (use cPanel ‚Üí **Backup** or **phpMyAdmin** export)

**cPanel Backup:**
1. Go to **Backup** or **Backup Wizard**
2. Download full backup or just database
3. Store securely offline

### Updating the Application

When a new version is released:

1. **Backup first** (database and `.env` file)
2. Download new version
3. Replace files (keep `.env` and `storage` folder)
4. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Clear caches: `php artisan config:clear`
6. Test thoroughly
